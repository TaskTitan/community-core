# 🤝 Contribution Guidelines for TaskTitan.ai

Welcome to the TaskTitan.ai development ecosystem! We're excited to have you contribute to our AI-powered workflow automation system. These guidelines will help ensure a smooth and effective contribution process.

## 🌟 Core Principles

1. **Simplicity**: Strive for elegant, simple solutions that solve specific problems.
2. **Performance**: Optimize for efficiency, considering the multi-user, multi-integration nature of our system.
3. **Modularity**: Design components and tools to be reusable and easily maintainable.
4. **User-Centric**: Always consider the end-user experience in your contributions.

## 🏗️ Architecture and Technology Stack

TaskTitan.ai employs a modern, class-based Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) architecture with a clear separation between frontend and backend codebases:

### Frontend
+ **Framework**: Vue.js 3
- **State Management**: Vuex
- **Routing**: Vue Router

### Backend
- **Runtime**: Node.js
- **Framework**: Express.js
- **Key Features**:
    &nbsp;
    RESTful API structure
    Controller-based architecture
    JWT for authentication

### Database
- SQLite3

When contributing, ensure your code aligns with this architecture:
- Follow the established OOP patterns in backend controllers and models
- Use Vue.js component structure and lifecycle hooks appropriately
- Maintain separation of concerns between frontend and backend
- Leverage Vue Router for frontend routing and Express.js for backend API endpoints
- Utilize the existing authentication mechanisms
- Use SQLite3 for database operations, following the existing model structure

## 💻 Code Style and Standards

1. Use vanilla JavaScript where possible, minimizing third-party dependencies.
2. Follow the existing code structure and naming conventions.
3. Write clear, self-documenting code with appropriate comments where necessary.
4. Ensure your code is compatible with our multi-user, queue-based system.
5. Adhere to OOP principles and patterns used throughout the codebase.

## 🛠️ Development Process

### Setting Up Your Environment

1. Fork the TaskTitan.ai repository.
2. Clone your fork to your local machine.
3. Set up the development environment following the instructions in our Dev Setup Guide.

### Making Changes

1. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
2. Write your code, following our coding standards above.
3. Test your changes thoroughly, including edge cases.
4. Commit your changes with clear, descriptive commit messages.

### Submitting a Pull Request

1. Push your changes to your fork on GitHub.
2. Create a pull request against the main TaskTitan.ai repository.
3. Provide a clear description of your changes and their purpose.
4. Be responsive to any feedback or questions from reviewers.

## 🧰 Tool Development

When creating new tools or modifying existing ones:

1. Follow the structure outlined in the Coding New Tools guide.
2. Ensure your tool is modular and can be easily integrated into various workflows.
3. Provide clear documentation for your tool's parameters and outputs.
4. Consider performance implications, especially for frequently used actions.

## 📚 Documentation

1. Update relevant documentation when making changes to functionality.
2. Use clear, concise language in all documentation.
3. Include examples and use cases where appropriate.

## 🎨 Frontend Development

1. Follow Vue.js best practices and the existing component structure.
2. Use Vuex for state management when appropriate.
3. Ensure responsiveness and cross-browser compatibility.
4. Optimize for performance, considering load times and resource usage.

## 🔧 Backend Development

1. Design with scalability in mind, considering our queue-based system.
2. Implement robust error handling and logging.
3. Write unit tests for new functionality.
4. Follow Node.js best practices and the existing module structure.

## 💡 Best Practices

1. **From Scratch vs. Packages**: Prefer writing custom solutions over importing large packages. This helps maintain a lean codebase and avoids unnecessary bloat. Only use well-established, lightweight, and widely-used packages when absolutely necessary.

2. **Performance-Centric**: Always consider the performance implications of your code, especially in our multi-user, queue-based environment.

3. **Security-Minded**: Implement security best practices, particularly when handling user data or integrating with third-party services.

4. **Maintain Compatibility**: Ensure your changes preserve existing functionality unless a breaking change is absolutely necessary and approved.

5. **Active Code Reviews**: Participate enthusiastically in code reviews, both as a submitter and a reviewer. This enhances code quality and facilitates knowledge sharing.

6. **OOP Adherence**: Strictly follow Object-Oriented Programming principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism when designing and implementing classes.

7. **Modular Design**: Create reusable and easily maintainable components and tools, aligning with our core principle of modularity.

8. **Comprehensive Testing**: Thoroughly test your code, including edge cases, to ensure reliability and robustness.

## 🐛 Reporting Issues

1. Use the GitHub issue tracker to report bugs or suggest enhancements.
2. Provide a clear, detailed description of the issue or suggestion.
3. Include steps to reproduce for bugs, and use cases for feature requests.
